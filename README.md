# CS230-Final-Project

Q1: Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a company that aspires to have their current game, Draw It or Lose It, developed as a web-based game. The game is similar to the game Win, Lose,     or Draw and requires the ability to have more than one team involved, multiple players per team, unique game and team names, and only one instance of the game         existing in memory at a time.  
  
Q2: What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe I did a good job at evaluating the modern Operating Systems and analyzing their strengths and areas of improvement on a server and client level. I also       think I included the proper tools from each Operating System that would be crucial in the development of a web-based game.
  
Q3: What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The design document helped me better realize the client's wants and requirements of the project that I needed to implement in my code. It also helped me address       which Operating System and Integrated Development Environment would prove the most useful depending on the type of project that was being coded.
  
Q4: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  When initially designing the executive summary for the final project, I wrote that Emulation was my best suggestion on implementing Draw It or Lose It. However, as I   continued reading the course material, I began to feel Virtualization was the better alternative because of its effective backup options and speed. If I could         improve the document, I would have suggested Virtualization from the start and used that as my focus when completing the rest of the design document.
  
Q5: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
  Based on the user's needs, I chose an Operating System, storage option, memory option, and architecture type that best suited their needs. For example, I had to       consider that the Gaming Room wanted 200 pictures included in their game and had to provide a storage option with at least 59.5 MB to accomplish this. These steps     are important in designing as customer satisfaction is the end goal of the project. 

Q6: How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I used "just in time" decision making to accumulate the best information I could before making a commitment to the software. I also used "just enough" action through   my designing and coding to meet the customer's needs, but not gold plate it and create waste. In the future I would like to use backwards designing or a top-down       approach when approaching similar projects of complexity.
